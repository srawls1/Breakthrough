# Breakthrough

A game developed as a group project in my programming studio class, originally hosted on Texas A&M's GitHub Enterprise. A digital recreation of the board game breakthrough (essentially chess with all pawns, where the win state is getting a piece to the end of the board), with an AI running on a server playing against a player who uses a GUI client.
